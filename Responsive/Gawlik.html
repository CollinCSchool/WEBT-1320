            <h2>Bill Gawlik</h2>
            <p>Bill Gawlik might be one of the most interesting people in the BÖC story simply because of how little is known about him. Sandy Pearlman claims he met Gawlik at Stony Brook University after transferring from the Rhode Island School of Design. It is implied that he was most likely an architecture major, but at the very least he was an art student. Pearlman claims that the most similar person to Gawlik would be Albert Speer, the architect for Hitler and future Germany. Each band member also has stories about him, most of which are about how different he was. Gawlik made the first two album covers and even designed their logo by accident. Gawlik's work includes his vision of what future America would look like: a post-apocalyptic/distopian barren land with repeating structures. His work was commonly drawn on huge sheets of buther paper with marker. These works would literally be scrolls that would stretch accross the length of a building. The only evidence of these scrolls are the actual album covers themselves and first-hand sources of those that had seen them. Gawlik was eventually replaced by various artists for future albums, Tyranny and Mutation was his final work for the band. He was let go by Pearlman because to an event related with law enforcement where he would be placed as the suspect for a murder due to his intense interest in what was going on at the scene.</p>

            <h3>Cathedral of Light</h3>
            <p>One of the best examples for the comparison of Gawlik being similar to Speer is the aesthetics of Speer's work. One of the most surreal designs by Speer is the Cathedral of Light. Using anti-aircraft spotlights spaced about every 12 meters apart, Speer designed what looked like pillars of light shooting up into the sky. Objectively a stunning picture to look at. All of Speers designs were symmetrical, and harsh. Gawlik's work looks very similar. Hard edges, 90 degree angles everywhere. With how little actual evidence of Gawlik's existence, and every story sounding unbelievable. Some argue that he was made up to add mystery to the Blue Öyster Cult lore, however, Pearlman confirmed he was still alive in 2005. Gawlik is probably are real person, but hard to trace due to his tendencies to lock himself in his room and work on his art. He was probably a hermit his whole life and may not have had much contant with people unfortunately.</p>
