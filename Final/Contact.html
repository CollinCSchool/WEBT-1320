            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>You can get in contact with me if you visit my socials! I am active on places like Instagram to show off some of my portfolio as well as message through dm's. I always check dm's at least once a day but give me at least 2 days to respond. Finally, if Instagram is not good for you, you can always reach me at my email!</p>

            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <p> <ul>Q: Do you work with other artstyles/genres?</ul>
                <ul>A: Yes! I work with pretty much anything but I prefer to work on something that I am more familiar with in order to provide something I think will be great.</ul></p>
                <ul>Q: Is there a specific time that you check messages/dm's?</ul>
                <ul>A: Nope! But I will check at least every 2 days assuming I do not look at messages at all in a day.</ul>
                <ul>Q: How long have you been doing art professionally?</ul>
                <ul>A: I started taking Photoshop seriously in October of 2022. It really has not been that long and I still have a lot to learn! I have been learning multiple softwares since then and each one allows me to create something a little different!</ul>

            <h4>Thank You</h4>
            <p>Thank you so much for looking at all of the art I have included throughout the website! I have so much more that is not included but I just do not have enough space to put it here. If you ever have any questions about my art just send a message, I love talking about it! This is my passion and I do everything in my ability to make something that I think everyone will enjoy.</p>
