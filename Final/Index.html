            <h2>A Love For a Future Past</h2>
            <p>Fox Wave is a brand that appeals to the Retrowave aesthetic, but is not limited to that genre. Other inspirations come from music and retro design. The idea of creating something that seems so surreal yet familiar is the goal of Fox Wave! Album cover design is one of the specialties of the work created here. Vaporwave and Synthwave are two of the most popular subgenres of Retrowave (which is a subgenre of Outrun) and heavy inspiration and design principles are taken into account when making any artwork.</p>

            <h3>Everything Here Was Made By Me!</h3>
            <p>Everything except for any font used was made by me! All art and animations were made in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Substance Painter, and/or Blender. I am self-taught in all of the programs and methods that I use to make my art. I aspire to make everything from album covers to designs for apparel. I was also the lead artist on an NFT project, the Funky Flamingo Club. There are many projects that I have worked on and there are is so much more that I want to do!</p>
