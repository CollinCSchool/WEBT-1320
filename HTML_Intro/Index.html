        <h1>History and Trivia of Blue Öyster Cult</h1>
    <hr>
        <h2>In the Beginning</h2>
        <p>The band Blue Öyster Cult as we know it started out rough. A group of college students attending Stony Brook University in New York finally struck a record deal. Electra, the label that had bands such as the Doors at the time, funded the fledling band Stalk-Forrest Group with $70,000 (That is nearly $500,000 in today's money!). To summarize the events, the group wrote and recorded a full-length LP under current lead vocalist, Les Braunstein. Braunstein, unhappy with the creative direction the band was taking, left and was replaced by new lead vocalist Eric Bloom. With no final product, Electra ended their contract and Andy Winters left being replaced by Joe Bouchard. Sandy Pearlman, the band's manager, convinced Columbia Records to let the band record a demo.</p>

        <h3>Formation of Blue Öyster Cult</h3>
        <p>After a few name changes and the group reassembled with new addtions to the lineup, the band renamed themselves to Blue Öyster Cult. This name comes from Sandy Pearlman's "The Soft Doctrines of Imaginos", an epic poem written by him in his high school years. Pearlman gave some members stage names: Jesse Python (Eric Bloom), Prince Omega (Albert Bouchard), La Verne (Allen Lanier), and Buck Dharma (Donald Roeser). Roeser was the only member to keep his stage name. They would finally release their self-titled debut album in 1972 featuring Bill Gawlik's art as the album art. This album has nine tracks and does contain the song "I'm on the Lamb, but I Ain't No Sheep" which is a redo of "I'm on the Lamb" from their failed Electra album. The album failed to go gold however, its peak position sat at 172 on the Billboard 200.</p>
